      In this experiment, you will see examples of conversations that real children had with their caretakers.  In each of these conversations, there is a sentence in which the child uses words like "no" or "not".  These are examples of <i>negation</i>.  We are interested in the different ways that children use negation when they are communicating with other people.
      <br><br>
      We are especially interested in two ways that children might use negation: 
      <br><br>
      <strong>
        1. Some negative sentences are used to describe the world around you.  This class of negation includes descriptions, observations, statements, comments, and facts.  For example, a child might say: <em>"this no funny."</em> In this example, the child is using negation to make a comment or a statement about the world.  
        <br><br>
        2. Other negative sentences are used as an attempt to change the world around you, or make your desires known to other people.  This class of negation includes refusals, rejections of a request, prohibitions, protests, and expressions of want/need/desire.  For example, a child might say <em>"no do not do that."</em> In this example, the child is using negation to tell another person what to do.  A child might also use this type of negation to express when they do not want some object (e.g. a type of food or a toy) that is being offered to them.
      </strong>
      <br><br>
      There are also two other options for how to classify the child's negation. 
      <br><br>
      3. The <em>repeat</em> option is to be used if you can tell from the dialogue that the child is simply mimicking something the caretaker has said, or is repeatedly saying the same statement over and over again. Please mark these as <em>Repeat</em>.
      <br><br>
      4. Finally, you'll see an option for <em>unclear/other/don't know</em>. Use this option if you feel that the sentence does not fit any of the above descriptions, or that the child's usage is unclear to the point where you cannot make a judgment, or you aren't sure how to classify the sentence.
      <br><br>
      <b>Please note that you may not need to use all four categories during the HIT. You might see a mix of different types of negation, or you might see examples of just one type of negation.  Don't worry if you find yourself choosing the same type of negation on several sentences in a row.  </b>

      On each page, you will be shown a dialogue between a child and other adults. These dialogues are written like a script, with the speaker identified at the beginning of each line.  
      <br><br>
      Statements made by the child will begin with "<em>*CHI: </em>". 
      <br>
      Statements by adults will begin with "<em>*MOT: </em>(mother)", "<em>*FAT: </em>(father)", "<em>*GRA: </em>(grandparent)", or "<em>*OPE: </em>(experiment operator)". 
      <br><br>
      Each dialogue
      will have the following format:
    </p>
    <ul class="later-block">
      <li>The first ten lines contain the conversation that occurred before the line where the child used negation.</li>
      <li>After these first ten lines, there will be a line in <strong>***bold***</strong> that shows the child using a negation, such as "no", "not", or "don't". Your job is to make a decision about this sentence based on the context of the conversation.</li>
      <li>After the child's negation statement there will be three lines of the conversation that followed the negation, to help make the conversation even more clear.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="later-block">
      These conversations were taken from recordings between parents and children.  The numbers at the beginning of each line represent the point in the recording where the conversation took place.  These numbers are just placemarkers and are not a part of the conversation, so you can ignore them.
